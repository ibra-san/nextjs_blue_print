This folder is going to be the blue_print for all of my NEXT JS apps. You just need to load this file from the GIT repository and get started with NEXT JS, rather than downloading NEXTJS everytime and doing the same setup over and over again. 

This was inspired from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfQCNuTMIGs&t=3s (This video includes the deployment to Vercle as well)
